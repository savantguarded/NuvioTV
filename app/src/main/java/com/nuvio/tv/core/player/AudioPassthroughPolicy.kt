/**
 * Which compressed audio formats may leave the box as a bitstream.
 *
 * Android reports what the HDMI/eARC chain claims to decode, and on several chains that
 * report is wrong: the platform offers DTS because the EDID advertises it, the app
 * bitstreams it, and the receiver produces silence. The only reliable correction is the
 * user, who knows what their gear can decode. Each flag therefore means "my receiver
 * handles this format" - on (the default) delegates to the platform report exactly as
 * before; off denies passthrough for that format so the renderer decodes it to PCM.
 *
 * Two deliberate safety properties:
 *
 * 1. [ALLOW_ALL] is the default everywhere, and with it this class denies nothing. A
 *    construction site that forgets to pass a policy therefore keeps current behaviour
 *    rather than silently changing it.
 * 2. A format is only deniable if a fallback decoder demonstrably exists for it. The
 *    five groups below are exactly the formats the bundled FFmpeg audio decoder handles
 *    (ac3, eac3, truehd, dca). AC-4, DTS Express and DTS:X P2 have no mapping in
 *    FfmpegLibrary.getCodecName, so they map to no group and are never denied - denying
 *    them would trade working passthrough for a track the renderer cannot decode.
 *    [softwareDecodersAvailable] is the second half of that guard: with the app's
 *    Decoder Priority set to "Device only" the FFmpeg renderer is absent from the
 *    renderer list, so nothing may be denied at all.

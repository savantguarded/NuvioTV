/**
 * The single implementation of "work out what the stream screen will auto-play,
 * and get it ready", run during a prefetch rather than after the Play press.
 *
 * Two call sites need this and there will be a third:
 *   - HomeViewModel, for the top Continue Watching entry (S4a-3).
 *   - MetaDetailsViewModel, for the hero button's target -- the movie itself,
 *     or a series' resume/next episode (S4a).
 *   - the episode list, once focus is observed (S4a-2).
 *
 * It exists as one class rather than a copy per ViewModel for the same reason
 * AutoPlaySelection does. A second copy of "predict what the stream screen will
 * pick" can drift from the first silently, and here the drift is not merely a
 * wrong prediction: preResolve spends the user's debrid account. One
 * implementation cannot diverge from itself.
 *
 * Measured on the Continue Watching path (25 Jul 2026, Xiaomi S905X5M, 4K DV,
 * auto-play "Best quality", 101 streams, TorBox):
 *   - ranking:  374 ms at the press -> 0.4 ms  (R2, nt24)
 *   - resolve:  1,049 ms at the press -> 34 ms (S4b-lite, nt25)
 *   - click -> PLAYER_START_REQUEST: 1,674 ms -> 720 ms
 * Neither number got smaller. Both moved off the critical path into the seconds
 * the user spends looking at a screen.

     * The waste case is a screen opened and never played. It is naturally
     * bounded: this runs only after the scrape has completed and the rank has
     * finished, so roughly 2-6 s of dwell is needed before a resolve starts at
     * all, and a new prefetch target cancels the previous job before then.
     * ⚠ But once started it is NOT cancellable from here -- DirectDebridResolver
     * runs it on its own CoroutineScope, so navigating away after that point
     * still costs one add.

     * Every guard lives inside resolve() already: shouldResolveToPlayableStream
     * returns false for a stream carrying a direct URL (Emby via the NAS
     * bridge, and any source the addon resolved server-side), for an
     * unsupported provider, and for a provider that is not the active resolver.
